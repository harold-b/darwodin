# Darwin platform bindings for Odin

Last generated for the following SDKs:
- MacOS 15.0
- iOS 18.0

Exhaustive macOS and iOS/iPadOS platform Objective-C framework bindings generated directly from the headers. 

### Frameworks
I've generated the frameworks on a as-needed basis as there are many and care needs to be taken when binding such that they refer to each other correctly. For that reason there are missing frameworks but they can be generated when needed.


### Explicit Overloads
The automatically generated bindings support explicit overload of procedures, and they are generated whenever possible.

Because Odin seems to disallow explicit overloads when the arguments of any 2 procedures match their types implicitly, I've opted to not resolve most typedefs to their underlying primitive types, as this allowed for a much lower overload conflict. Therefore they have been kept unresolved and marked as `distinct` types.

There are cases where the overload conflicts still happen, in such cases the overloads are not generated.

Some care can be taken later to relax many of these restrictions and resolve most typedefs.



### Enum Element Names
Filters are applied to enum elements as a best effort attempt to remove any redundant prefixes.

There may be cases where I've missed that a specific enum is meant to be used as flags and I did not mark it as such, thus a bit_set might not have been generated for it.

### Method naming
There are cases when a class method shares the same name with an instance method. When this conflict occurs, the class method will have the suffix "Static" applied to its name. 

When overload methods have the same selector, excluding a trailing ':`, then its last parameter's name will be appended to the method name to avoid conflict.

### Protocols
Objective-C protocols that share the same name with an Objective-C class have their name modified by applying a suffix of "Protocol" to their type name *(e.g. the protocol `NSObject` becomes `NSObjectProtocol`)*.

When extending objects you can currently only conform to a single protocol per object extension.

### Other notes
Although type info about generic types is generated by the type definition step of the binder, it is not used when generating the Odin code.
